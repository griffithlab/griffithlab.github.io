## Research Overview
Our research is committed to development of open access and open source resources for cancer genome analysis. Research projects cover a wide spectrum of cancer informatics and clinical statistics with an emphasis on translation and application. Specifically, we use computational methods for the analysis of large cancer datasets at the molecular level (DNA, RNA and protein) to identify markers for diagnosis, prognosis and drug response prediction in cancer. We have contributed to the early development of methods for analysis of transcriptional regulation (ORegAnno) and RNA-seq analysis and visualization (Alexa Platform).

    Dr. Obi Griffith is Assistant Professor of Medicine and Assistant Director at the McDonnell Genome Institute. Dr. Griffith's research is focused on the development of personalized medicine strategies for cancer using genomic technologies with a particular focus on gene regulatory changes associated with breast cancer. He develops and uses bioinformatics and statistical methods for the analysis of high throughput sequence data and identification of biomarkers for diagnostic, prognostic and drug response prediction.
    <br>
    Dr. Griffith has developed and instructs a workshop on RNA sequence analysis for Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories and is a regular instructor for the Canadian Bioinformatics Workshops series. He was recently awarded an NCI K22 Transition Career Development Award. In the past, he has received numerous other awards from Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd., Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council, University of Winnipeg, University of British Columbia, Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) and British Columbia Cancer Agency. He was a Junior and Senior Trainee of the Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research and received both doctoral and post-doctoral fellowship awards from CIHR. He was profiled in Maclean’s magazine as one of Canada’s 25 ‘Best and Brightest’ for his contribution to the sequencing of the SARS genome. He has also been profiled as an 'up and coming investigator' by Genome Technology Magazine and as an emerging talent in Wired Magazine's Annual 'Smart List'.
    <br>
    Before coming to Washington University, Dr. Griffith completed bioinformatics post-doctoral fellowships at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley, California and at the BC Cancer Agency Genome Sciences Centre in Vancouver, British Columbia. He received his Ph.D. (Medical Genetics, 2008) from the University of British Columbia and B.S. (Biochemistry and Biology with Honors, 2002) from the University of Winnipeg.

    Dr. Malachi Griffith is an Assistant Director of the McDonnell Genome Institute and an Assistant Professor in the Department of Genetics. Dr. Griffith's research is focused on the development of genomics, bioinformatics and statistical methods as they apply to the study of cancer biology and medicine. A particular focus of his work is in the translation of genomics data from whole genome, exome and transcriptome sequencing into clinically actionable observations and personalized cancer therapies.
    <br>
    Dr. Griffith is also an instructor for the Canadian Bioinformatics Workshops series. He has received scholarships from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council and was a Junior and Senior Scholar of the Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research. He has also received a Research Studentship from the National Cancer Institute of Canada and Terry Fox Foundation and was ranked #2 nationally in the Biomedical Research Category. Dr. Griffith is currently supported by a K99 pathway to independence grant (NIH K99-HG007940).
